              We three brothers started this foundation on our parents name to create awareness among people about cancer screening programmes like MAMMOGRAM and PAP SMEAR test which are the basic screening tests for every female to detect early stages of breast cancer and cervical cancer.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700">
              Both Mammogram and Pap smear tests are costly investigations which a normal person cannot afford to get them done. With the help of our foundation we will do this screening tests along with diabetic and hypertension check ups at a lowest price, so that it will be affordable to every individual.

              In India, only 1 in every 2 girls have knowledge about menstruation before their first menstrual period. Menstrual hygiene management is a major health issue affecting women and girls of reproductive age worldwide. School aged girls in many villages face the largest barriers to Menstrual hygiene, as many schools do not have the necessary facilities, supplies, knowledge and understanding to appropriately support girls during menstruation.

              Every living being requires certain basic things to lead a peaceful life. While things like clothes and shelter affect the quality of life, the absence of food can snatch life itself. "Annadanam" is made up of two words - 'Annam' which means food and 'danam' which means the act of giving or donating.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700">
              Annadanam is called the 'Mahadanam' among the various kinds of danam. The other kind of danam like 'bhoodanam', 'godanam' and 'arthadanam' are charity done by the rich and those who have the means to do so, whereas annadanam is within the reach of a layperson with just the bare necessities who could do danam.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700">
              Charity in the form of annadanam is a way in which you can contribute to life itself. The wise men of ancient India called hunger the greatest disease. It is a disease that afflicts everyone and there is no cure for it.
